# Kings Code  scaffold


```
vue create my-app
cd my-app
vue add vuetify
vue add kingscode-scaffold
npm run serve
```

Mind that some of the choices you make in the `vue create my-app` and 
later in the `vue add vuetify` will be overwritten by vuetify or the kings code scaffold.

for instance the Kings Code scaffold always has fontawesome as icon font.
